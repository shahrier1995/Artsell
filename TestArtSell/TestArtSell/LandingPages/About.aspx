                        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Microsoft JhengHei Light',sans-serif; font-weight: normal">Art is something we do, a verb. Art is an expression of our thoughts, emotions, intuitions, and desires, but it is even more personal than that: it’s about sharing the way we experience the world, which for many is an extension of personality.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Microsoft JhengHei Light',sans-serif; font-weight: normal">It is the communication of intimate concepts that cannot be faithfully portrayed by words alone. And because words alone are not enough, we must find some other vehicle to carry our intent. But the content that we instill on or in our chosen media is not in itself the art. Art is to be found in how the media is used, the way in which the content is expressed.</p>
                        <br />
